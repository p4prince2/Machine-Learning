# Machine-Learning
Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! ðŸš€ This repository contains code, datasets, and documentation for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

# About
This project is focused on applying machine learning techniques to solve [real world problemâ€” e.g., "classification of handwritten digits", "predicting house prices", "driver safety prediction", etc.].
It covers the entire ML workflow: data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment.

# Technologies and Libraries Used
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

Scikit-learn

PyTorch / TensorFlow

# Workflow
Data Collection: Gather the dataset used for training and testing.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data.

Model Building: Designing machine learning models (classification, regression, etc.).

Model Training: Training the model with the prepared dataset.

Evaluation: Measuring performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, etc.).

Deployment (optional): Exporting the model for production use.

# How to Run
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/p4prince2/Machine-Learning.git
```
```
cd Machine-Learning
```
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the training script or open the Jupyter notebooks:

```
python src/train.py
```



# Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning

- Multiple machine learning models

- Metrics tracking (accuracy, loss)

- Well-commented and modular code

- Easy to extend for new models or datasets

# Results

Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	92.5%
Random Forest	95.0%
SVM	93.8%
# Future Work
Improve model performance with better hyperparameter tuning

Test on a larger and more diverse dataset

Deploy as a web service (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI)

Add support for model interpretability (e.g., SHAP, LIME)
